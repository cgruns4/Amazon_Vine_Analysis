### Summary
- There appears to be a positivity bias for non-reviews, but not for reviews. This can likely be attributed to a consumers preference to ubmit a review when
  they encounter a less then perfect experience.  
- We could provide further analysis on the all star ratings, and attain a weighted average of overall rating for both reviews and non-reviews.
